[![Create a Slack Account with us](https://img.shields.io/badge/Create_Slack_Account-The_Carpentries-071159.svg)](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)

Our aim with this lesson is to empower GLAM ([Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(industry))) staff with the foundation to support, participate in and begin to undertake in their own right, machine learning based research and projects with heritage collections. 

After following this lesson, learners will be able to:
* Explain and differentiate key terms, phrases, and concepts associated with AI and Machine Learning in GLAM
* Describe ways in which AI is being innovatively used in the cultural heritage context today
* Identify what kinds of tasks machine learning models excel at in GLAM applications
* Identify weaknesses in machine learning models   
* Reflect on ethical implications of applying machine learning to cultural heritage collections and discuss potential mitigation strategies
* Summarise the practical, technical steps involved in undertaking machine learning projects
* Identify additional resources on AI and Machine Learning in GLAM
